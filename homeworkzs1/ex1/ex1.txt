A <header> with the title "FluidBiz Co." and a navigation bar containing links: Home, Services, Testimonials, and Contact. 
Three <div> elements with the classes .services, .main-content, and .testimonials. A <footer> mentioning "Copyright Â© 2023 FluidBiz Co." 
Basic Styling: Link your styles.css in your HTML. Set a basic style:

Set a background color for the body and different background colors for the header, columns, and footer to distinguish them. Fluid Layout:

Set the width of the .services and .testimonials columns to 25% and the .main-content to 50%. Float the .services to the left, 
.testimonials to the right, and .main-content to the left. Ensure that the columns sit side by side. Populate Content:

Inside the .services column, list down at least 3 fictional services offered by FluidBiz Co. For the .main-content, 
write a brief introduction about FluidBiz Co. and what they specialize in. In .testimonials, include 3 fictional testimonials
 from satisfied customers. Responsiveness:

Ensure your layout is fluid. Test by resizing your browser window. Bonus: Add media queries to stack the columns vertically when 
the screen width goes below 768px. Review:

Make sure there's no horizontal scrollbar at any screen size.

Tips: Remember to clear floats after your columns to prevent layout issues. Ensure proper content hierarchy with the use of <h1>, <h2>,
 and so on. If you finish early, enhance your design by adding images, hover effects, or any other additional styling.
